Description: It uses the point velocity hydrometric measurement data from the stream cross-section. It includes the functions to discharge by three standard methods: graphical Harlachers, mid-section segments, mean-section segments. It also includes the function to evaluate discharge from interpolation of velicities. It can be used to visualise the interpolated mesh of velocities in the stream cross-section.
